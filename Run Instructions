## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

üé® Frontend
The HTML template is located in templates/index.html.

Styles are in static/styles.css.

Make sure the templates and static folders are correctly placed in the project root.

Place the app.py file in the main (root) project folder alongside the templates and static directories for Flask to locate the files correctly.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Run the Flask app:
python app.py

The terminal will show a local URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

Open the URL in your web browser to access the Weather Dashboard.

Enter a city and optionally a country to fetch the current weather.
